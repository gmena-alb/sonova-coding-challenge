# Sonova Coding Challenge - Implement desktop + mobile landing page

This is a solution to the coding challenge proposed for Frontend developer position

## Overview

### The challenge

- Time box your work up to 4 hours. We would like the page to be not only functional, but rather an impression of your development skills, style and design knowledge.
- Please focus on the quality over quantity of the page.
- You can use Lorem Ipsum for the text samples.
- Please feel free to use any JS or CSS frameworks if it helps speed up the development process.
- Please feel free to use `git` (or `GitHub`, `GitLab` or `BitBucket`), whichever works best for you.
- As a frontend Engineer, we emphasize on the user experience, so please invest your wisely and always focus on the UX. Please write the production quality code, keep it clean, maintainable and extendable.
- Once you have finished your work, compress the project code directory as a `.zip` file and send it back!
- Assets also available in https://info.geers.de/zdf/

### What I did

- I built this site using mobile first approach. The layout works from +340px screens.
- I added an intermediate layout for tablets, from +768px the code checks when the page is open and resized to show the correct layout.

### How to make it work

- Open the root folder in the terminal
- Run the command

```
npm install && npm start
```
